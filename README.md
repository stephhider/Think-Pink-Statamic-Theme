Think Pink Theme for Statamic

This theme is based off of the baseline <a href="https://github.com/statamicthemes/statarkers-theme">theme</a> put together by Garth Redfern. It uses the <a href="http://getuikit.com/index.html">UIkit framework</a>, <a href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">lightbox2</a> and <a href="http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/">owlcarousel</a>. The theme requires a Statamic license which is purchase-able from their <a href="http://www.statamic.com/">website</a>. Special thanks to Jason Varga for the <a href="https://github.com/pixelfear/Statamic-Globals">global addon</a>. It was designed by <a href="http://stephaniehider.com">Stephanie Hider</a> in honor of her Grandmother who is a breast cancer survivor for 25 years&nbsp;now.

The demo can be found at <a href="http://thinkpink.themegoodness.com/"> here </a>

In the _config/settings.yaml you will want to change the theme to "themegoodness_thinkpink"
If the global addon is installed correctly in your admin you should see the global tab here you can modify the theme's logo for the header footer, swap out the pink colors, add your tracking codes and input your social profile links. There is also a section for the default sidebar items that allow you to turn on and off the sub nav, events and add callouts.

You should see content areas to populate for blog, our team, events and programs. You can delete any of these that you don't wish to use in the content folder. 

And of course if you know your way around Statamic you can easily swap, delete and change things as you need. Please send me a shout if you need any help or find any bugs or issues.
