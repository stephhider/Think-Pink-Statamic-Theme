====================================
  NOTES
====================================

Enter your Google analytics code here, you can just enter your account id here UA-XXXXX-X.

The analytics code is wrapped in a conditional which will stop google from tracking your site when
on a development server. You will need to add "disable_analytics: true" (without the quotes) in your 
dev yaml file. This is located in the environments folder which is located in the _config folder.

Once this is in place you can set up your eviroments in the settings.yaml file located in the _config folder.
